Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects
This repository contains source code for the projects that i did as a part of the deep learning nanodegree programme in udacity.

This Repo contains the following projects:-
1) Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns using a NN built from scratch (project 1)
2) Dog-Breed classifier using Transfer-Learning (Pytorch)
3) TV Script generation using LSTM network(Pytorch)
4) GAN face generation
5) Sagemaker deployment



Requirements:-
1)Pytorch
2)Python 3.6
3)Numpy
5)Matplotlib
6)Pandas
